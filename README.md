# Decentralized Wildfire Prevention and Response System

A blockchain-powered platform that transforms wildfire management through distributed sensing, coordinated response, and transparent resource allocation.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized network for wildfire prevention, early detection, resource coordination, and community evacuation management. By combining IoT sensor data, predictive analytics, and smart contract automation, we enable faster response times, more efficient resource utilization, and improved community safety during wildfire events.

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Risk Mapping Contract

- Vegetation condition monitoring and fuel load assessment
- Historical fire pattern analysis and seasonal risk adjustment
- Climate prediction integration for forward-looking risk assessment
- Transparent risk level calculation with multi-factor scoring
- Geospatial representation of fire danger across monitored regions
- Automated alerting when regions cross risk thresholds

### 2. Early Detection Contract

Manages distributed sensor networks for rapid wildfire identification:

- Smoke detector and thermal camera data ingestion and validation
- Satellite imagery analysis for hotspot detection
- Community report verification and triangulation
- False positive filtering through consensus mechanisms
- Confidence scoring for potential fire events
- Automated notification routing to relevant authorities
- Detection audit trail for system improvement

### 3. Resource Deployment Contract

Coordinates firefighting equipment and personnel during response operations:

- Real-time resource inventory and capability tracking
- Dynamic dispatch recommendation based on fire characteristics
- Multi-agency resource sharing and mutual aid coordination
- Equipment maintenance status and readiness verification
- Personnel qualification and availability management
- Operation logging with timestamp and geolocation
- Cost tracking and resource utilization metrics

### 4. Evacuation Management Contract

Organizes community safety measures during wildfire emergencies:

- Dynamic evacuation zone determination based on fire behavior
- Evacuation route optimization accounting for real-time conditions
- Shelter capacity management and resource allocation
- Vulnerable population identification and assistance prioritization
- Transportation coordination for evacuation support
- Check-in/registration system for evacuated residents
- Family reunification assistance and tracking
